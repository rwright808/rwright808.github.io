Xenia-2 Sounding Rocket Airframe
======
Seeing Xenia-2 displayed in the UVic Rocketry Clubroom is surreal to me, as I spent a lot of time working on this rocket.
The academic term before competition, many of the team's senior and shop users were away on coop. This caused a large portion of the rocket's manufacturing to fall to me. Combined with how I had just finished my coop in the school's machine shop and recently earned superuser status, I did not feel ready to lead the manufacturing of the rocket. Despite this, I quickly got to work and spent the summer preparing drawing packages, working with other members to improve the manufacturability of their designs, and machining rocket parts. At the end of it all, we successfully launched Xenia-2 at Launch Canada 2023. Below are pictures of some of the parts I manufactured for the rocket.

Machine Guided Parafoil (MaGP-I)
======
I quickly joined the UVic Rocketry team as a freshman, and MaGP-I was my first project. MaGP-I was concieved by previous team members as a way to implement a guidance system on a competition legal sounding rocket. Spaceport America Cup and Launch Canada rules prohibit guided rockets however, deployable payloads are allowed, which can be guided. As a green freshman, the prospect of working on the same guided parachute problem SpaceX solved to catch their Falcon 9 fairings, I was excited to start the project. As expected, I was not experienced enough to successfully solve the problem, and I failed to complete it for our rocket Xenia-1 at the 2022 Launch Canada competition. However, the MaGP-I taught me many valuable lessons on how to approach a complex engineering project. Here are some of the lessons I learned:

When I have some spare time, I sometimes work on this project. This definitely won't be the last update
