I am extremely proud of the mechanical design of the AUV main enclosure. I joined my school's AUV design team AUVic because of a few of my friends, and I was tasked with designing and manufacturing the main enclosure.

The biggest lesson I learned on this project is that CAD is just a model of the real world. While working on this project, I was also spending a lot of time working on modeling a hybrid rocket engine, and I was thinking about things in terms of models. One of my favorite quotes about modeling is by George Box, who once said "All models are wrong, some are useful" (which I think is brilliant). CAD is wrong because it doesn't show you real world features like the nominal dimensions and the non-circularity of your stock. Despite this, we can all agree that CAD is an extremely useful design tool. I think this is an important perspective to have while working on CAD. Without this perspective, it is too easy to make things that are only practically possible rendered in CAD; Some of my friends have created the term "CAD-Vision" to describe this phenomenon.
 
The main enclosure is a product of this lesson. I recieved mentorship on this design by Rodney Katz, Sr. Scientific Asistant and head of the UVic Mech Machine Shop. From his advice, I was able to design an efficient AUV Main Enclosure. This design succeeded in keeping the internal electronics waterproof at the Robosub 2023 competition. 

This project was also a good introduction to designing seals. I learned about the different considerations that go into designing sealing surfaces, like manufacturability, surface finish, type of seal and selecting O-Rings.
