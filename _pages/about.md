Hello, I am Ryan and I made this website to display some of my engineering projects as a Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Victoria. Here, I am an active member of a few engineering clubs, where I have had the priveledge to apply what I have learned in class on some exciting projects.

While researching topics in mechanical engineering, I have come across other portfolio websites that have inspired me as an aspiring mechanical engineer. I hope my work also inspires you. Feel free to send me an email if you would like to discuss any of my projects.
